You can now use the ScaffoldVuer in your vue template as followed:
```html
<ScaffoldVuer url="Metafile.json" v-on:scaffold-selected="ScaffoldSelected"  style="height:50%"/>
```

url should be a variable/string containing the url of a compatible json model.
scaffold-selected is the custom event triggered when a part of the 3D-scaffold is selected, see below for a
sample callback.

```javascript
  methods: {
    ScaffoldSelected: function(annotation) {
     console.log(annotation);
    }
  }
```
